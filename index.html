             <img src="basketball.jpg" alt="Basketball Image">
             <p>Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor. He developed the game as an indoor activity to keep his students active during the winter months. The original game had thirteen basic rules and was played with a soccer ball and two peach baskets as goals.</p>
             <p>Over the years, basketball has evolved significantly. The establishment of professional leagues, including the NBA in 1946, helped popularize the sport worldwide. Today, basketball is played at various levels, from school teams to international competitions, and remains one of the most-watched sports globally.</p>

             <h2>Basketball Fundamentals</h2>
             <p>Basketball is a fast-paced sport that requires agility, teamwork, and strategy. The basic rules involve two teams trying to score points by shooting the ball into the opposing team’s hoop. Players must dribble the ball while moving and adhere to rules such as the shot clock and fouls.</p>
             <p>Key skills in basketball include dribbling, passing, shooting, and defensive techniques. Players often specialize in specific roles, such as point guard, shooting guard, or center, each contributing uniquely to the team’s success. Mastering these fundamentals is essential for any aspiring player.</p>
